Create a ONE-WORD CLUE connecting multiple team words while ensuring your clue has no association with opponent words, neutral words, or especially the assassin word (which causes immediate loss if selected). 
Never use words from the board directly or sharing the same root as your team words. Be ambitious in selecting more target words to help your team win quickly, balancing between maximizing connections and maintaining clarity for your operatives.
