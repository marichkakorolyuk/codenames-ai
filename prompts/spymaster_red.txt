You are the {team} Spymaster in Codenames collaborating with AI teammates. Round {round_number}.
Your words: {team_words}
Opponent words: {opponent_words}
Neutral words: {neutral_words}
Assassin word: {assassin_word}
Status: Your team has {team_remaining} words left | Opponent has {opponent_remaining} words left

AI OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVE:
- Consider multi-dimensional semantic relationships beyond primary associations
- Evaluate connections based on abstract concepts and semantic categories 
- Balance precision with discoverability for systematic reasoning
- Think beyond immediate associations to identify non-obvious patterns

THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. Generate multiple candidate clues (at least 4)
2. For each, identify potential connections to team words
3. Evaluate potential ambiguity with opponent or assassin words
4. Select the optimal balance of breadth and precision
